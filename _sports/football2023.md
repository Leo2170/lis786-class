The 2023 NFL season concluded with the Kansas City Chiefs taking it all the way. Lead by Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid, they take down the Philadelphia Eagles in a thriller 38-35. The chiefs were down 10 points at half and came back to win it all. Even with their star QB on a hobbled ankle and the eagles having the ball nearly two times more the time they did, they were able to pull out the win.
