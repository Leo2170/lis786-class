Another major thing that has also happened recently is that we finally see the Lamar Jackson contract era end. Lamar and the Ravens finally reach an agreement with $185 million guaranteed and over $200 in 5 years. Many people thought he was going to be traded because it felt like the Ravens thought he wasn't worth what he wanted. At last, he got paid everything he deserved.
