This is my page about the Soccer all over the world. Soccer is the biggest sport in the world, and it growing rapidly in the U.S, but it's still far behind when compared to 
European soccer and clubs.

## Last Weekend

In the EPL, we had a marquee matchup being Arsenal vs Manchester City which was crucial to the title race. Unfortunately for the Arsenal side, they lost and the title is no longer in their hands. At one point they had a 7 point lead in the table and have now bottled it. They fell to City in a 4-1 defeat.

On Sunday, we were also treated to a high scoring game between Liverpool and Tottenham. Liverpool turned it around in around 15 minutes, and they were down 2-0 to go up 3-2. In the 93rd minute, Richarlison scores off a free kick to tie the game 3-3. In the end though, it didn't matter as Liverpool scored right after in the 94th minute, and they took the win in a devastating loss for the Spurs.
