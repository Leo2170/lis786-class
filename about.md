Here at SportsZone, we just love sports. We talk about everything that happens and want to have a platform in which everyone can voice their opinion and have a civil discussion. You go to Twitter and under every post, there's people just insulting each other, completely forgetting what they were discussing at one point. It will be heavily moderated to avoid those types of interactions.
